# R scripts - LabMetaMass Analysis


This repository contain R scripts for metabolomic data analysis. The scripts were developed based on the research at LabMetaMass. 

LabMetaMass is a research group at the University of Campinas, SÃ£o Paulo, headed by Prof. Dr. Alexandra C. H. F. Sawaya. The group focuses on the Metabolomic data analysis of Brazilian medicinal plants and how environmental and agricultural conditions affect the metabolism of such herbal medicines. 

Metabolomics research usually starts with sample analysis using an LC-MS equipment. The data generated by this technique, then, is preprocessed before initial statistical analysis. After the pre-processing, exploratory data analysis is performed, following by typical and appropriate statistical tests.

## Scripts

- IPO and XCMS - Metabolomics preprocessing 
- Basic Heatmap
- Basic Climate Graph
- PCA (in progress)
- Correlation tests (in progress)
- SVR Normalization (in progress)

Note that these scripts contain detailed comments, as their use was also intended for members of the LabMetaMass research group with no experience in R language.
